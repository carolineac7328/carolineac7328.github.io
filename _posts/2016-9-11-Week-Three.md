title: Week Three
---

## What did you do this past week?
In lecture this week we discussed the basics of pointers and references and went through some examples to test our knowledge of what is and isn't allowed in C++. We also went over the basic data types in C++ and learned about how to make user defined types using structs and classes. We discovered that a struct is similar to a public method in Java, and a class is similar to a private method. Professor Downing also discussed the benefits of enumerted types in C++, and we went through some examples of using templates. Outside of lecture, I finished Project 1 with some minor hiccups, and caught up on the reading in the class. 

## What's in  your way?
Right now, I really need to work on understanding pointers and references. After two semesters of using pointers in C, I still struggle with understanding how they work completely. The quiz on Friday during class really made me realize that it's something I need to work on.

## What will you do next week?
This week I want to get a head start on the next project and make sure we can get everything set up early. I also need to continue editing my resume and applying for jobs since the career fair is a little over a week away. I'd also like to go to some of the company events in our department this week to work on my networking skills.

## My experience with the class so far.
So far the class is still going well, and I've really enjoyed the material so far. I like how we compare and contrast C++ to Java because it helps me understand the concepts better. It's also nice to go through topics that we learned freshman year but might have forgotten because I feel like I can grasp it better now that I've taken other classes and understand how everything works behind the scenes. 

## Tip of the week:
Since the career fair is coming up soon and we're all starting to think about applying for jobs, I wanted to remind everyone to use the College of Natural Sciences career website, Handshake. I know a lot of friends who have never used or looked at the site, but I've found that it's the most effective way to submit your resume and schedule on campus interviews with companies. Recruiters at the career fair have always told me to apply through Handshake because that's how they can request interviews with you and have access to our information more easily, so if you haven't made an account yet, I would suggest doing so in the next week!
