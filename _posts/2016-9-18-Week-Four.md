## What did you do this past week?
In lecture this week we discussed the next programming project, Netflix. We also had a guest speaker from Bloomberg come and tell us about the industry and what he does as a software engineer. On Friday, we learned about the equal() function and discussed memory accesses and pointers in more detail. Outside of class, my partner and I started working on Netflix, but got stuck several times because of issues with Boost and getting everything set up to run on Docker correctly.  

## What's in  your way?
My biggest challenge right now is trying to figure out how to use the Boost library, and making sure we have enough time to get the project done. My main focus this week is recruiting and applying for internships, so I need to make sure and budget my time so I can get all of my school work done.

## What will you do next week?
This week I want to catch up on the readings for this class, since it has kind of been on the backburner. I really enjoy the topics that we discuss in class, so i want to learn more about it from the book. Also, we need to finish Netflix and give ourselves enough time to go to office hours and ask questions. I also need to start studying for tests coming up in a couple of weeks.

## My experience with the class so far.
Class is still going well, and I find the topics we cover to be very interesting. I think I'm finally starting to understand pointers and references a bit better the more we talk about it in class. I thought the guest speaker from Bloomberg was pretty cool because it reminds us that school is just a temporary thing, and we'll eventually be able to work in the field we love. Quizzes are kind of a bummer, but this week they went surprisngly well. 

## Tip of the week:
My tip of the week is to make sure you have someone proof read your resume before handing it out to recruiters at the career fair this week. Look online for some examples of good resumes, go to the resume events in our department and the CNS, and have a couple peers or professors look it over to make sure there aren't any grammatical or visual errors.
