## What did you do this past week?
This week we discussed some of the different common methods used in C++, such as equal and copy, and what types of iterators they take in as parameters. We wrote some of these methods on our own, which definitely helped me understand them more. We also had a guest speaker from JPL come and tell us about the virtual reality tools they are using to view the landscape of Mars. He explained the concept of what makes software "good", and discussed how we can create good software ourselves. Outside of class, my partner and I finished up Netflix, and I attended the CNS career fair on Tuesday.

## What's in  your way?
Tests are going to start piling up this week, so I need to balance my time and possibly start studying for the test in this class. I've fallen behind on the readings, so I need to make sure I catch up on that before I become too crunched for time. I also need to stop procrastinating on projects, because last Thursday was a bit stresful trying to get the project wrapped up in time. 

## What will you do next week?
This week I will make sure and start early on the next programming project. I will also study for my algorithms test, apply to more jobs, and try to catch up on the textbook readings for this class. 

## My experience with the class so far.
Besides the dreaded quizzes, I feel like I'm learning a lot every lecture. I enjoy Downing's teaching style of challenging us to write the methods ourselves because it's good practice for the tests and I feel like I understand it better than just listening to him explain everything that we do. I feel like I've got a good grasp on the types of iterators now. 

## Tip of the week:
Here's a link to some common behavioral interview questions, and some advice on how to answer them. It also explains what the recruiters are looking for in a candidate when they ask these types of questions. Good luck to everyone on their upcoming interviews! <https://biginterview.com/blog/behavioral-interview-questions>.
