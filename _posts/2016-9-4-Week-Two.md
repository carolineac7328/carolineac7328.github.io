## What did you do this past week?
This week we were assigned our first project, Collatz. In lecture we discussed the basic steps for how to get started on the project, and we went through other possible algorithms for solving the problem. On Friday, Professor Downing explained the differences between pre and post incrementing in C++, which was super informative and caused me to rethink how I increment variables in future projects. We also reviewed different strategies for testing our code and learned about how using exceptions in our code is a clean and informative way to pass information between methods as opposed to using global variables. Outside of class, I started to familiarize myself with the project and the necessary tools we need to use. Unfortunately, I had several issues installing Docker and getting it to work properly on my Windows machine. After going to the TA office hours and Professor Downing's office hours however, I realized that I was not the only one struggling and was able to get all of the kinks worked out. 

## What's in  your way?
Right now, my biggest struggle is making sure I give myself enough time to get this first project done. The assignments and readings in my other classes are starting to pile up, and I didn't plan on spending so much time trying to get everything set up for the project. I don't think it will be too difficult to code the solution to Collatz, but I definitely need to allow extra time in case one of the tools isn't working correctly. I also need to start preparing for the Natural Sciences Career Fair and updating my resume.

## What will you do next week?
This week I plan on finishing the Collatz project and going to office hours to make sure I've included all of the different components to the project correctly. I also need to start applying to internships for next summer and catch up on some reading for this class and others. 

## My experience with the class so far.
I've really enjoyed the topics we've covered in class so far, and I don't really have any complaints. I liked that we spent a couple days in class talking about the project and going over the steps to set it up properly because I felt really unsure about what to do when the project was first released. I also enjoyed the funny analogy that Professor Downing made when discussing different testing methods and thought it really helped me understand the concept of assertions better. 

## Tip of the week:
One thing that I've always struggled with in school is overcoming procrastination. I tend to put assignments off until the day (or night) before they're due because I'm usually more motivated when I'm under pressure. This is something that I've definitely been working on throughout college, and I learned this week that procrastinating in this class is not an option (especially when there's so many new things to learn and get comfortable with). If I hadn't started on Collatz when I did, I wouldn't have been able to go to office hours and get help with setting up Docker. Now that we all have deadlines coming up in our classes, I thought I would share an article with some good tips for eliminating procrastination and getting motivated. Some of my favorite ones listed are breaking down your work into smaller, more manageable tasks so it doesn't seem as overwhelming, working on assignments with others to help you stay motivated, and changing up your work environment to get out of your old habits.
